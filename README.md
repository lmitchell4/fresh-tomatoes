# Fresh Tomatoes Video Trailers

This Python program generates a website that displays trailers for movies 
and TV shows.


## Installation

Clone or download all of the files in the project. You will need to 
have Python installed on your machine in order to run the Python
scripts. The project was built under Python 2.7.12, but is simple enough 
that it should work in both Python 2 and 3. Very minimal testing was 
done to verify that it would run in both 2.7.12 and 3.4.3.


## Usage

Run the Python script entertainment\_center.py to generate and open the html 
file containing the video trailers. The resulting html file will be called 
fresh\_tomatoes.html. Each time entertainment\_center.py is run, it will 
overwrite the existing html file. 

Movies and tv shows can be added or removed from the website using the 
file entertainment\_center.py. Note that the classes used in this file are 
defined in media.py. To make changes to the html, css, and js code, 
use the file fresh\_tomatoes.py.
